...or it can done with JavaScript. This JavaScript example opens the new site in a new browser window after a 4.5-second (4500 ms) delay:

 <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
     <!--
     window.setTimeout('window.open("http://example.com/","newsite")',4500);
     // -->
 </script>
